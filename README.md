This is port of the Super Metroid Redux hack, using the original port as a basis. The hack and all of its features can be found here: https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4963/

The only difference in building this port is that the rom you provide has to be a patched Super Metroid Redux rom. For building instructions, see: https://github.com/snesrev/sm/blob/main/BUILDING.md

This version of the port has mismatches disabled for the time being. Credits and thanks to ShadowOne333 for creating the hack, to Metroid Construction and its members for creating many of the patches used, and to PJBoy's bank logs.
